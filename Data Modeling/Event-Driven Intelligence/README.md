## Projects in Detail

### <u>[Daily Balances System: Building Financial Intelligence](./Daily%20Balances/)</u>
*Transforming transaction logs into actionable daily balance insights*

#### <u>The Challenge</u> <small>
In the fast-paced world of financial operations, stakeholders frequently need accurate historical balance information:
- "What was a client's wallet balance last Tuesday?"
- "How many units of Product X did Client Y hold two months ago?"
- "What was our total inventory position at any given point in time?"

What seemed like simple queries revealed a fundamental data engineering challenge: transforming granular transaction logs into meaningful point-in-time snapshots. </small>

#### <u>Solution Architecture</u> 
This system comprises three distinct but similar models:

| Model | Purpose | Key Features |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| [Client Account Balance](./Daily%20Balances/Account%20Balance/) | Daily cash position tracking | • Complete transaction history<br>• Daily balance snapshots<br>• Automated reconciliation |
| [Portfolio Balance](./Daily%20Balances/Portfolio%20Balance/) | Asset holdings monitoring | • Product-level tracking<br>• Lien management<br>• Available units calculation |
| [Inventory Position](./Daily%20Balances/Inventory%20Balance/) | Company-wide stock tracking | • Location-wise tracking<br>• Daily position updates<br>• Historical snapshots |

#### <u>Technical Implementation</u> <small>
1. **Data Engineering Pipeline**
   - Raw log ingestion via Airbyte
   - Incremental processing with Apache Airflow
   - Real-time data synchronization
2. **Analytics Engineering**
   - Modular SQL transformations
   - Python scripting for file handling and configuration management
   - Database operations using pandas for data processing
   - Power BI dashboards
3. **Advanced Technical Concepts**
   - Window Functions: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `FIRST_VALUE()`, `SUM() OVER`
   - Python Implementation:
        - Path handling with os.path for script directories
        - ConfigParser for credential management
        - Pandas for SQL execution and data transformation
        - Conditional logic for data deduplication
        - Date operations for temporal processing
   - Automated update processes
</small>

#### <u>Impact</u> <small>
- Reduced balance inquiry response time from hours to seconds
- Enabled historical analysis and trend identification
- Improved operational efficiency through real-time visibility
</small>

### <u>[Digital Presence: Modeling User and Host Event](./Digital%20Presence/)s</u>
*Advanced event tracking system for digital engagement analysis*

This project addresses the challenge of understanding user and host activity patterns through sophisticated event tracking. By transforming unstructured event data into analyzable metrics, it enables deep insights into digital engagement trends.

#### <u>Key Components</u>
- **User Device Tracking**: 
  - Browser-specific activity monitoring
  - Structured date mapping with deduplication and incremental processing
  - Date-based activity transformation and optimization
  - Engagement pattern analysis

- **Host Activity Analysis**:
  - Monthly engagement summaries
  - Unique visitor tracking
  - Hit pattern analysis

#### <u>Technical Highlights</u>
- Advanced array operations for efficient data storage
- Bitwise encoding for optimized performance
- Complex window functions for trend analysis
- Date-based inequality joins for temporal analysis

_One record in the final table represents the summarized activity of a specific host for a given month. It consolidates daily event data into a more efficient format, making it easier to analyze long-term trends in host engagement._

### <u>[Actor Performance: A Dimensional Approach](./Actors%20Performance/)</u>
*Historical analysis system for entertainment industry metrics*

This project implements a sophisticated dimensional modeling approach to track and analyze actor performance over time. It enables complex trend analysis and historical performance tracking through advanced SQL features and custom data types.

#### <u>Key Features</u>
- Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) implementation with cumulative updates, backfilling, and incremental updates to maintain data integrity
- Custom enumerated types for performance classification
- Array operations for actors' history management
- Complex window functions for temporal analysis

#### <u>Technical Architecture</u>
- Custom composite types for structured data storage
- Advanced array operations for actors' history tracking
- Sophisticated window functions for trend analysis
- Hybrid key structure for optimal querying

_One record in the final table represents a historical record of an actor’s performance classification and activity status for a specific period._

## Best Practices & Lessons Learned

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient index design: Strategic use of window functions to avoid multiple table scans
   - Optimized query patterns: Implementation of incremental updates to process only new data
   - Balanced batch sizes for processing: Breaking down complex queries into manageable CTEs for better readability and performance

2. **Maintainability**
   - Modular transformation logic: Separation of backfill and update scripts for better maintenance
   - Comprehensive documentation: Clear file naming conventions (e.g., `*_backfill.sql`, `*_update_script.py`)
   - Version-controlled SQL and Python code for code management
