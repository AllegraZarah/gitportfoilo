# Data Quality Framework

## Overview

This repository presents a structured approach to ensuring data quality across analytical workflows using two complementary frameworks: **dbt** and **Great Expectations (GX)**. These projects implement automated validation, enforce business rules, and enable scalable data governance practices to ensure that data remains accurate, complete, and reliable.

| Project                 | Focus Area                        | Key Technologies              |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **[Data Quality with dbt](#data-quality-with-dbt)**  | Model-Level Testing & Transformations | dbt, SQL, dbt_expectations   |
| **[Data Quality with GX](#data-quality-with-great-expectations)**   | Data Asset Validation & Orchestration | Great Expectations, Python, Airflow |

## Project Summaries

### **[Data Quality with dbt](./dbt/)**
- Focuses on validating data within transformation pipelines.
- Implements **schema and source tests** (e.g., freshness, uniqueness, referential integrity).
- Uses **custom macros** and `dbt_expectations` for enhanced business rule enforcement.
- Enables **automated execution** through dbt Cloud or scheduled runs.

### **[Data Quality with Great Expectations](./Great%20Expectations/)**
- Applies **expectation suites** to enforce quality rules at the data asset level.
- Uses **custom expectations** to address domain-specific validation needs.
- Orchestrates validation runs via **Airflow DAGs** and Python automation.
- Stores validation results in **JSON outputs** for tracking and reporting.

## Why Data Quality Matters

- **Ensures Trust in Analytics:** Reliable data quality translates into accurate insights.
- **Reduces Manual Effort:** Automating data validation minimizes human intervention.
- **Enhances Data Governance:** Enforcing validation rules supports regulatory compliance and operational consistency.
- **Prevents Costly Errors:** Early detection of data issues prevents downstream reporting inaccuracies.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integrate Real-Time Monitoring**: Enable streaming data validation for dynamic datasets.
- **Expand Custom Tests**: Develop additional domain-specific rules for deeper validation.
- **Enhance Alerting Mechanisms**: Automate notifications for test failures and anomalies.
- **Build Quality Dashboards**: Centralized visualization of validation metrics across both frameworks.

This repository serves as a foundation for scalable, automated data quality management, ensuring that high standards of integrity and consistency are upheld across analytical workflows.
