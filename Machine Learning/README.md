## **[Customer Segmentation Project](./Customer%20Segmentation/)**  

### **Project Summary**  
This project applies **RFMT (Recency, Frequency, Monetary, Tenure) analysis** to segment clients based on their transaction behavior. The goal is to enhance **client engagement, optimize retention strategies, and inform product offerings** through targeted analytics.  

### **Data Sources**  
- **Client RFMT Activity Dataset** ‚Üí Historical transaction records.  
- **Business Clients Clusters** ‚Üí Pre-classified business client clusters.
- **Business Clients Demographics** ‚Üí Firmographic data (company size, sector, location). 

### **Methodology**  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ RFMT Cluster Analysis**  
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify behavioral trends.  
- Engineered RFMT features and applied **KMeans clustering** for segmentation.  
- Business clients segmented into **Low, Mid, and High-Value tiers**.  

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Modeling for Early Classification**  
- Developed **classification models** to predict client segments at registration.  
- Evaluated performance using **accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall**.  
- Tuned hyperparameters and compared multiple ML models.  

### **Results & Insights**  

#### **üè¢ Business Clients**  
- **Best Model:** **Gradient Boosting Classifier** (76% accuracy, 73% F1 score).  
- Identified **key purchasing behaviors** that distinguish high-value clients.  
- Model performance was influenced by dataset size and feature completeness.

#### **üîë Key Business Insights**  
- **Personalized engagement** ‚Üí High-value clients respond well to tailored incentives.  
- **Operational efficiency** ‚Üí Low-value clients require different onboarding approaches.  
- **Strategic resource allocation** ‚Üí Marketing can focus retention efforts on key segments.
