# Oluwatomisin's Portfolio Repository

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository showcases various data-related projects I have worked on, including data engineering, analytics engineering, and more. Each project is organized into its own directory with detailed documentation and code.


## About Me

I am a data engineer and an analytics engineer with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. This portfolio is a collection of my work, demonstrating my skills in data engineering, analytics engineering, and more.

_**Fun Fact!** - The best part of my work is **playing detective with data**â€”uncovering the hidden stories it is trying to keep secret!_

Thank you for visiting my portfolio repository!
